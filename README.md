send a email PHPmailer is extremely strong and was something I taught myself to use 
during my Summer 2015 internship at <a href="http://forrestgreen.com/" >Forrest Green</a> as a Intern Software Engineer.

During my position as an intern, and in independent projects I found this Mailer to be a size effecient, code-effecient tool that gets the job done.

Most common use of this tool: 
<ol>
  <li>
  Verify user email accounts
  </li>
  <li>
    Send invitations for users to come sign up to your application
  </li>
  <li>
    Send reset passwords, or notifications of account activity to preset and preverified user email address
  </li>
  <li>
    Pretty much <b>ANYTHING</b> email related. 
  </li>
</ol>
